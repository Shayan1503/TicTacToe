# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe game that uses a minimax algorithm for its AI

Run `tictactoe.exe` to play the game and `test.exe` to run tests on the AI. These files can be found in the `Executables` folder.

This project will happily welcome any contributor willing to optimise my minimax algorithm or
clean up my code a little.
